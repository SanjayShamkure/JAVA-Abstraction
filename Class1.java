/* 1. Abstraction is one of the OOPs principle in java.
 * 
 * 2. Hiding the implementation code and providing only functionality to the end user is called abstraction.
 * 
 * 3. The scenario of Abstraction is "if customer is visiting or making use of any application, 
 *    then he should utilize functionality only & he should not feel any back end code processing.
 * 
 * 1. Abstract Class :-
	
	1. A class declared with "abstract" keyword is called abstract class.
	
	2. An Abstract class is nothing but an incomplete class where programmer can declare complete as well as 
	   incomplete methods in it.
	
	3. Programmer can declare incomplete methods as abstract method, by declaring keyword called "abstract" 
	   in front of method.
	
	4. We can't create object of abstract class, to create object of abstract class we need to make use of 
	   concrete class.
    
    2. Concrete class :-

	A class which provides definitions for all the incomplete methods which are present in abstract class 
	with the help of extends keywords is called concrete class.
